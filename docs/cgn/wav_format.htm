<h1><a name="wav"></a>The .wav format</h1>
<p>The format that has been used for the audio files is the RIFF-WAVE format. 
  The audio encoding varies, depending on the nature of the recording. The standard 
  audio encoding in the Spoken Dutch Corpus has a sample frequency of 16kHz and 
  a resolution of 16 bit PCM. A different encoding has been used for the recordings 
  of telephone dialogues. These recordings were made in two ways: they were recorded 
  on Mini Disk (MD) via a local interface or they were recorded via a switchboard. 
  The MD recordings have an 8 kHz sample frequency and a 16-bit PCM resolution. 
  The recordings via a switchboard have a sample frequency of 8kHz and a 8-bit 
  A-law resolution. In this case, speakers have been recorded on separate channels. 
  Both channels have been combined into one stereo signal, so that the transcribers 
  can hear both sides of the conversation. This, we found, leads to better transcriptions.</p>
<p>The procedure to combine the two channels has been improved over time. A number 
  of audio files have been re-processed after they had already been transcribed. 
  As a consequence, the orthographic transcription is correct in terms of content. 
  However, it may happen that the segmentation is not exactly in place, but may 
  be off by (on average) 115 ms.</p>
<p>The corpus comprises both stereo and mono recordings. For dialogues and multilogues 
  generally stereo has been opted for, since this may make it easier to distinguish 
  between speakers.</p>
<p>The audio files all have the extension .wav. Programs such as <a href="../../tools/viewers/praat/info.htm">PRAAT</a> 
  and <a href="../../project/corex/info.htm">COREX</a>, but also most other mediaplayers 
  both on pc and other platforms can be used to play the recordings. Both PRAAT 
  and COREX make it possible for the user to view the orthographic transcription 
  while playing the audio.</p>
